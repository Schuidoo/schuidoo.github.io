        <img src="../Images/ProfilePicture.jpg" alt="Profile Picture">
        <p>Hi there! My name is Kevin Schu√∂cker, and I am a professional developer from Vienna, Austria. 
          I am currently working as a test manager at Expleo and am serving as an external test manager for 
          a smart metering project. I have been developing software since early 2019 and have experience in 
          a range of programming languages, including C#, VBA, Access, PL/1, and Java. I am particularly skilled 
          in C# and SQL and have a deep understanding of database management. With a strong attention to detail 
          and a commitment to delivering high-quality work, I am dedicated to creating innovative solutions that 
          meet the needs of businesses and individuals alike.</p>
        <p>When I'm not managing tests or coding, I like to spend my free time playing computer games, 
          practicing sports, and skateboarding. I also enjoy spending time with my friends and family, 
          whether it's exploring new places or simply relaxing at home. These hobbies not only help me 
          recharge my batteries but also give me a fresh perspective on problem-solving, which is 
          incredibly valuable in my work as a developer.</p>
        <p>
          I am always striving to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the industry. 
          I believe that continuous learning is key to staying competitive and providing the best possible solutions 
          to my clients. I am excited to continue growing and learning as a developer and am eager to take on new 
          challenges and opportunities in the field.
